That is possible. Or let them just click a confirm button. Not sure if this conforms to the law but the option is there.

= Can I set the age I want? =
Oh yes it sure can! Up to a 110.

= Is half of it unusable because I have to pay? =
No. The entire thing is free and it will be in the future.

= Does is comply with European law? =
I am not entirely sure since it is a big grey area as with all web-applications and plugins. But it shows that you are willing to work on it.
